            <p>Impalas came in a full complement of body styles, and accounted -- as usual -- for the lion's share of sales. Impala output, in fact, totaled 556,800 cars with V-8 power and 18,800 carrying six-cylinder engines, plus the Super Sports.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box second">
            <p>The name "Impala" comes from a gazelle/antelope native to Africa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box third">
            <p>A black 1967 Sport Sedan 4-door hardtop was used in the television series Supernatural, and as such, this model has seen a substantial increase in value to collectors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box fourth">
            <p>The first year the Impala had a 327 V8 Turbo-Jet was in 1962. These engines also powered Corvettes, Novas, and Chevelles through the 1960s.</p>
