                    <li>For 1967, full-size Chevrolets were facelifted around the same basic shape as 1965-66 with distinctive tweaks. The coke bottle shape was exaggerated, and front and rear fenders had a pinch line along the top. The two-door Hardtop now had a long smooth roofline, sweeping down the trunk. The grille was extended to wrap around the front fenders, a collapsible steering column was added, disc brakes were now optional and shoulder belts fitted to closed cars. The 1967 Chevrolet Impala was still the companyâ€™s best seller with 575,600 sales. Impala Super Sport sales totaled 76,055.
                    </br>
                    The Impala had six models: two- and four-door Hardtops, four-door Sedan, a Convertible and six-passenger and nine-passenger wagons. The Super Sport series offered a two-door Hardtop and Convertible with all vinyl interior, bucket seats and console, badges, blackout grille and special hubcaps. The Impala SS 427 package included a power-dome hood, stiffer suspension and bigger wheels.
